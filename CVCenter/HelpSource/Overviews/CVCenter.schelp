TITLE:: CVCenter
SUMMARY:: a library aiming at the easy use of external hard- and software controllers within SuperCollider
CATEGORIES:: Conductor, External Control>MIDI, External Control>OSC

CVCenter is built upon the concept of code::CV::s by Ron Kuivila. Its name-giving class CVCenter holds a collection of CVs and allows the user to easily create graphical widgets that let her/him easily connect their external MIDI- or OSC-controllers. Widgets can be created from Synth-, Ndef-, NodeProxy-controls respectively it can also be used in connection with slots of a ProxySpace.
As CV inherit from Stream CVs may be used in Patterns as well (just like you would embed a regular Pattern in another).

NOTE::There is a newer version of CVCenter available which offers a number of new features and improvements (e.g. a multi-slider widget and customizable shortcuts). However, I consider that version to be experimental and it is available from Github only: link::https://github.com/nuss/cvcenter::. At the current moment I am not planning to replace the old CVCenter with the new one within the Quarks repository. If you have installed CVCenter as a Quark I would recommend uninstalling the Quark and to reinstall CVCenter via GIT-client from Github. This allows you to easily switch between versions: if you find a bug in the new version you may at any time switch back to the old version.::

EXAMPLES::
code::
Ndef(\sawTest, { |damping| SinOsc.ar(damping * VarSaw.ar(\sawFreq.kr([100, 101]))).tanh * \amp.kr(0.5) });

// Ndefs don't have metadata but you may add some specs ahead from creation
Spec.add(\sawFreq, \freq);
Spec.add(\damping, #[200, 20000, \exp, 0.0, 1000, " Hz"]);

// create the GUI
// have a look at the NodeProxy helpfile to see all possible arguments for cvcGui
Ndef(\sawTest).cvcGui;

// play the Ndef (turn the knobs if you don't hear anything immediately)
Server.default.waitForBoot{ Ndef(\sawTest).play };

// maybe play around with specs a bit...
#[lo, hi].do(CVCenter.cvWidgets[\sawFreq].setSpec(#[20, 220, \exp], _);
CVCenter.cvWidgets[\sawFreq].setSpec(#[17, 170, \exp], \lo);

// clean up
CVCenter.removeAll;
Ndef(\sawTest).clear(10);
