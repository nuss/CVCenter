DESCRIPTION::
A CVWidget2D is widget that can be used to set e.g. controls in running link::Classes/Synth::s, link::Classes/Ndef::s, link::Classes/ProxySpace:: slots, link::Classes/NodeProxy::s and other other values that can be set at runtime. Also it may be used in connection with link::Classes/Pattern::s. Contrary to link::Classes/CVWidgetKnob:: it holds two link::Classes/CV::s.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Create a new CVWidget2D. To display the widget on screen you must call code::front:: on the resulting object.

argument:: parent
an instance of link::Classes/Window:: - optional. If none is given the it will be created internally.

argument:: cvs
an link::Classes/Array:: of link::Classes/CV::s - optional. If none is given it will be created internally. The array may hold code::2:: link::Classes/CV::s.

argument:: name
a link::Classes/String:: or a link::Classes/Symbol:: - optional. If none is given the widget will be named "knob".

argument:: bounds
a link::Classes/Rect:: - optional. If none is given the widget will be created with a default size.

argument:: defaultActions
an link::Classes/Event:: holding code::2:: link::Classes/Function::s - optional. By default the link::Classes/Event:: has to look like code::(lo: lofunction, hi: hifunction)::. The functions may be given as a link::Classes/Function:: or a link::Classes/String:: that compiles to one when link::Classes/String#-interpret#interpret:: is called on it. If an argument is added to the functions it will provide the widget's link::Classes/CV::. E.g.: code::{ arg cv; cv.value.postln }::

argument:: setup
optional - an link::Classes/Event:: containing the following optional keys in two separate code::Events:: -> code::(lo:(<setup-lo>), hi:(<setup-hi)):::

definitionList::
## midiMode || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setMidiMode::. default: code::0::
## midiMean || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setMidiMean::. default: code::64::
## midiResolution || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setMidiResolution::. default: code::1::
## softWithin || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setSoftWithin::. default: code::0.1::
## ctrlButtonBank || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setCtrlButtonBank::. default: code::nil::
## calibrate || see link::Classes/CVWidget#-setCalibrate::. default: code::true::
::

argument:: controllersAndModels
if a widget wraps a link::Classes/CV:: that has been created within some the CVWidget the models and controllers of that other widget can be added here. CVWidget2D expects the parameters to be passed in in an link::Classes/Event:: containing the keys code::\lo:: and code::\hi::: code::(lo: wdgtControllersAndModels-lo, hi: wdgtControlersAndModels-hi)::. However, it is emphasis::not:: recommended to do so as there are specific methods that allow you to recreate widgets that have already been closed. See also link::Classes/CVWidget#-wdgtControllersAndModels::. 

argument:: cvcGui
a multi-purpose argument: usually you will not set anything here. It is used with the link::#-open:: method resp. link::Classes/CVCenter::. Within these it is used to pass in OSC-/MIDI-responders resp. the widgets MIDI-/OSC-environment. See also link::Classes/CVWidget#-midiOscEnv::

argument:: persistent
if set to code::true:: the widget's OSC-/MIDI-responders will not be removed when the widget gets closed - default: code::nil::

argument:: server
only used for link::Classes/SwingOSC:: compatability (untested)

returns:: this (a CVWidget2D)


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: open
If a widget has been created with the argument code::persistent:: set to true the user may reopen the widget with this method. This is basically a workaround due to the fact that GUIs in SuperCollider usually can't be opened again once they have been closed (even though executing the variable storing the the regarding object still returns the object). However, rather than reopening the old widget this method will create a new one, holding all properties, the CV and MIDI-/OSC-responders. In order to make this work as desired one should apply the following syntax where code::x:: holds the instance of the initially created widget:

code::x = x.open // the old widget was stored in x which will afterwards hold the new widget::

See example in link::Classes/CVWidget#reusable_widgets::

argument:: parent
a link::Classes/Window:: or code::nil:: - if none is provided the window will be created internally

argument:: wdgtBounds
a link::Classes/Rect:: or code::nil:: - if none is provided the bounds of the old widget will be used.

returns:: a link::Classes/CVWidgetKnob::

subsection:: GUI-elements
warning::Opposite to link::Classes/CVWidgetKnob:: many elements of the GUI are returned as link::Classes/Event::s containing a code::\lo:: and a code::\hi:: element. Basically all of the following elements are strong::getters:: but not strong::setters::. However, it is possible to change the value returned in code::\lo:: or code::\hi:: as they are simply values within an link::Classes/Event:: - strong::do not attempt to do so or unexpected things will happen!::
::

METHOD:: slider2d
The link::Classes/Slider2D:: on the top of the left side of the widget. It allows the user to set two values at once. The horizontal axis of the slider represents the value of link::Classes/CVWidget#-widgetCV#widgetCV.lo::, the vertical axis the value of link::Classes/CVWidget#-widgetCV#widgetCV.hi::.

returns:: a link::Classes/Slider2D::

METHOD:: rangeSlider
The link::Classes/RangeSlider:: on the bottom of the link::Classes/Slider2D::. It allows the user to set two values at once. The left end of the bar represents the the value of link::Classes/CVWidget#-widgetCV#widgetCV.lo::, the right end the value of link::Classes/CVWidget#-widgetCV#widgetCV.hi::.

returns:: a link::Classes/RangeSlider::

METHOD:: numVal
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/NumberBox::es, displaying or setting the current value of the widget's link::Classes/CV::s.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: specBut
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s, linking to the regarding spec-tab within the widget's editor ( code::\lo:: or code::\hi::) (see also: link::Classes/CVWidgetEditor::)

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: midiHead
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s linking to the regarding MIDI-tab within the widget's editor ( code::\lo:: or code::\hi::) (see also: link::Classes/CVWidgetEditor::)

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: midiLearn
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s ( code::\lo:: or code::\hi::) that, if clicked, either triggers the MIDI-learn functionality (button-label: "L") or creates a link::Classes/CCResponder:: for the values entered in link::#-midiSrc::, link::#-midiChan:: or/and link::#-midiCtrl:: (button-label: "C"). If a link::Classes/CCResponder:: is present the button-label gets changed to "X" - upon clicking the responder gets removed again.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: midiSrc
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two code::TextField::s ( code::\lo:: and code::\hi::), each displaying the ID of a connected MIDI-device. If no link::Classes/CCResponder:: is present one may enter the ID of a device (if known) and when clicking the link::#-midiLearn:: button the widget will create a link::Classes/CCResponder:: listening to that device.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: midiChan
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two code::TextField::s ( code::\lo:: and code::\hi::), each displaying the channel for an existing link::Classes/CCResponder:: or, if none is present, one may use this field to set the channel for which the link::Classes/CCResponder:: shall be created.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: midiCtrl
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two code::TextField::s ( code::\lo:: and code::\hi::), each displaying the controller-number of an existing link::Classes/CCResponder:: or, if none is present, one may use this field to set the controller-number for which the link::Classes/CCResponder:: shall be created.
note:: SuperCollider numbers hardware-controllers internally beginning with code::0:: - if code::0:: gets entered here the controller will be displayed as code::1:: as most devices will probably number their knobs and sliders beginning with code::1::. Also, the way controller-numbers are displayed is related to the code::ctrlButtonBank:: setting which can be set with link::Classes/CVWidget#-setCtrlButtonBank::
:: 

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: oscEditBut
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s ( code::\lo:: and code::\hi::) that link to the widget's OSC-tabs within the regarding link::Classes/CVWidgetEditor::. If an link::Classes/OSCresponder:: is present, the button-label will display the command-name, the message-slot and the current link::Classes/CVWidget#-setOscMapping#OSC-mapping:: (if the button is big enough to display all this information - mapping can be code::\linlin::, code::\linexp::, code::\explin:: or code::\expexp::).

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: calibBut
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s that link to the OSC-tabs within the regarding link::Classes/CVWidgetEditor::, displaying the current link::CLasses/CVWidget#-setCalibrate#calibration::-status.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::

METHOD:: actionsBut
An link::Classes/Event:: containing two link::Classes/Button::s, each linking to the actions-tab within the widget's regarding link::Classes/CVWidgetEditor::s. The button displays the number of active actions resp. existing actions in total.

returns:: an link::Classes/Event::
