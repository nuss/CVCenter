subsection:: Extensions by CVCenter

method:: cvcGui
Creates link::Classes/CVWidget::s for the controls of a running link::Classes/Synth::.

argument:: displayDialog
If set to code::false:: widgets will be created immediately without allowing to edit specs ahead from creation.

argument:: prefix
As link::Classes/CVCenter#*all#CVCenter.all:: cannot contain a name twice you may add a custom prefix to avoid CVCenter from trying to overwrite existing keys.

argument:: pairs2D
An link::Classes/Event:: that creates a link::Classes/CVWidget2D:: rather than a link::Classes/CVWidgetKnob:: for the given control-names and the given widget-name:

code::(widgetName1: #[controlName1_lo, controlName1_hi], widgetName2: #[controlName2_lo, controlName2_hi], â€¦ widgetNameN: #[controlNameN_lo, controlNameN_hi])::

argument:: environment
If the link::Classes/Synth:: is stored in an link::Classes/Environment:: which is different from your link::Classes/Environment#-currentEnvironment#currentEnvironment:: this environment may be passed in explicitly.

returns:: this (a link::Classes/Synth::)

note:: If the user doesn't provide the object in a variable or the variable-name can't be determined fallback-actions will be created ( code:: s.sendBundle(s.latency, [...])::). However, these will address the object's nodeID. If the object gets removed and recreated with a new nodeID the actions will stop working.::
