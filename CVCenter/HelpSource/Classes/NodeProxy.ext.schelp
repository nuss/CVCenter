subsection:: Extensions by CVCenter

method:: cvcGui
Creates link::Classes/CVWidget::s for the controls of a link::Classes/NodeProxy::, an link::Classes/Ndef:: or a key in a link::Classes/ProxySpace::.

argument:: displayDialog
If set to code::false:: widgets will be created immediately without allowing to edit specs ahead from creation.

argument:: prefix
As link::Classes/CVCenter#*all#CVCenter.all:: cannot contain a name twice you may add a custom prefix to avoid CVCenter from trying to overwrite existing keys.

argument:: pairs2D
An link::Classes/Event:: that creates a link::Classes/CVWidget2D:: rather than a link::Classes/CVWidgetKnob:: for the given control-names and the given widget-name:

code::(widgetName1: #[controlName1_lo, controlName1_hi], widgetName2: #[controlName2_lo, controlName2_hi], â€¦ widgetNameN: #[controlNameN_lo, controlNameN_hi])::

Defining pairs2D is strong::only:: necessary if 1-dimensional controls shall be combined in a CVWidget2D - 2-dimensional controls will automatically result in a CVWidget2D.

returns:: this (a link::Classes/NodeProxy::, an link::Classes/Ndef:: or a link::Classes/ProxySpace::-slot)
